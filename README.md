# Quantile Bandits for Best Arms Identification 

This repository provides the implementation for paper *Quantile Bandits for Best Arms Identification*.
The codes are tested on Python 3.6.

* codes: 
    - Environment: implements the bandit environments (arm reward distributions)
    - BAI_FixedBudget: BAI algorithms (for both mean and quantiles), including Q-SAR and baseline algorithms
    - SimulatedGames: Simulate experiments
    - plots: plot result

* notebooks:
    - Group One Simulation (Fig 4 first row)
    - Group Two Simulation (Fig 4 second row)
    - Vaccine Simulation (Fig 6)
